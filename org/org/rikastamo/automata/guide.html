<h1>  How to use Automata</h1>
<h3>
  Start of by deciding what kinds of elements (menu, header, maintext, footer) you are going to need in your 
  composition. It is a good idea to scetch their positions and placement on paper. Create a new document in Automata and select the right kind of proportions for the document. 
  Fill in the wanted components. Export document both as css and svg. Open up the SVG in vector software and build the graphics for the document. 
  Export the vector layout as jpg-images by using the grid to slice-up the document. Write the necessary html with div and img tags to use your text and graphics with the css-layout. 
</h3>
<h3>
You can also use dynamic page creation. Just write out div id:s in your server-side script that match the layer names in your document.
